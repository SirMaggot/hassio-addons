# deCONZ

After installing and starting this addon in Hass.io, access the deCONZ WebUIs to add ZigBee devices:

- Wireless Light Control at http://hassio.local:[web_port]

- Phoscon at http://hassio.local:[web_port]/pwa

Configure Home Assistant's deCONZ component from the Overview page (if `discovery:` is enabled in configuration.yaml, or, if not, by adding `deconz:` to configuration.yaml and restarting Home Assistant).
